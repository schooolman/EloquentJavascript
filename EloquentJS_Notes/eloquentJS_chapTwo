Eloquent Javascript -- CHAPTER TWO

Variable names can have numbers in them but they cannot start with numbers.

At any point a varaiable can be disconnected from it's current value by using the = operator.
--- I though this was an interesting way to think about using the = operator on variables, as
--- a way to disconnect a variable from it's current values.

Another way to think about variables as though they are tentacles. Not used to forever store things, but used to grasp things while they are needed. If you need a new variable, grow a new tentacle or use an existing one.

A single var statement may define multiple vairables. The definitions must be seperated by commas however.

Return Values
--- Anything that returns a value in Javascript is considered a function. All functions are said to return values.

You can use the keyword "break;" whithin a for loop to break out of a loop at any given time.
