----- Chapter 3: Functions -----

Some functions produce a value and some dont and only produce a side effect.

A return statment determines the value the function returns. When control comes across such a statement, it immediately jumps out of the current function and gives the returned value to the code that called the function.
	- The return keyword without an expression after it will cause the function to return undefined.

An important property of functions is that the variables created inside of them, including their parameters are local to that function.

Variables declared outside of a function are scoped globally as opposed to locally.

Treating local variables within functions helps to make it more readable. Each function can be understood as small universes.

Nested scopes take variable scoping one step further. They can see all varaibles scoped on the same level as them, but not into each others functions.

In Javascript the only thing that will create a new scope is a function. This is called lexical scoping.

Closures

Local variables are re-created for every call -- different calls can't rample on one another's local variables.

A function that "closes over" some local variables is called a closure. 

--- May need to revisit closures for the one millionth time.

A function that calls itself is called recursive. Recursion allows some functions to be written in a different style. 

Running through a loop is a lot cheaper than calling a function over and over and over again.

How difficult it is to find a good name for a function is a good indicatation of how clear a concept it is that you're trying to wrap.
